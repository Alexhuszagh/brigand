# Introduction

Brigand is a light-weight, fully functional, instant-compile time C++ 11 meta-programming library.

It provides a sequence called brigand::list (but will work with any MPL sequence) and a solid amount of meta-algorithms and meta-functions to work fully functional MPL programs.

This library is still a work in progress and we welcome your feedback.
